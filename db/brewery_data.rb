      Washington DC Now has it!

      Yes, the capital of the United States of America now has a beer to call its own. A beer brewed within the city limits and available citywide. A beer representing a delicious and uniquely American blend of North American and European techniques and ingredients. A beer that looks just as inviting in a pint glass at the neighborhood bar as in its handsomely designed can on a picnic table at an Appalachian campsite. A beer that pairs just as well with summer's barbecued bounty as with a hearty winter stew. A beer crafted in our nation's capital that reflects the great state of brewing in the United States today."

      description: "3 Stars Brewing Company is a brewery delivering on the promise of bringing locally hand crafted artisanal ales to the DC beer community.  The company was founded by Dave Coleman and Mike McGarvey, two longtime friends who decided to seize the opportunity to build a brewery and produce high quality beer in the District of Columbia – hoping to make this world-class city a world-class craft beer destination.

      Mike and Dave started out as homebrewers, developing recipes on a homebrew lab system in Mike’s basement. What began as a hobby, soon became the main focal point of their attention. The duo then realized that building a brewery in D.C. was just the type of project they had been looking for. They began writing business plans, searching for a suitable property to house the brewery, and discussing the project with local friends and business associates as a potential investment opportunity. With an unwavering dedication to crafting and brewing unique, complex, forward thinking beers the guys set out a path for the brewery with the purpose of creating highly innovative drinking experiences."

      description: "Born of love. Perfected by science. Hellbender Brewing Company was created out of a true love for the art, culture, history, and science of craft brewing. We have created every recipe as an artistic interpretation of an existing style, and refined it with years of fine tuning and tasting. Lots of tasting. Hellbender Brewing Company was born from the shared passion for beer of co-founders and long-time District residents Ben Evans and Patrick Mullane. Both homebrewers when they met, they’ve been brewing together for nearly 10 years.

      Ben, our President and Head Brewer, is a former microbiologist and neuroscientist that left the laboratory life in favor of the much bigger science experiment that is Hellbender Brewing. He personally directs daily brewing activities, recipe development and quality control, where his science and brewing experience are crucial to ensure our beer is made according to the highest standards.

      Patrick’s road to brewery founder was less direct. He worked for 12 years as a congressional aide on Capitol Hill, moonlighting as a server and cook on the side for much of that time. Patrick directs all business, sales and marketing activities and helps brew when there’s a break in the seemingly endless paperwork and red tape."

      ALLOWING BEER DIRECTOR GREG ENGERT, HEAD BREWER JOSH CHAPMAN AND THEIR TEAM OF BREWERS TO CREATE BEERS ACROSS THE BROADEST RANGE OF STYLES AND FLAVORS POSSIBLE. AT BLUEJACKET,UNDERSTANDING OF AND RESPECT FOR THE TRADITIONS AND TECHNIQUES OF CLASSIC BREWING COEXIST WITH A SPIRIT OF CONSTANT EXPERIMENTATION, INNOVATION AND COLLABORATION, LEADING TO DELICIOUS BEERS THAT SHOWCASE SEASONALITY, CULINARY INSPIRATION, AND HISTORIC INTERPRETATION. EXPECT BEERS THAT RANGE FROM INTENSELY FLAVORED TO SUBTLY NUANCED; THAT OFFER SOMETHING DISTINCTIVE AND SATISFYING FOR EVERY PALATE AND EVERY PLATE; AND THAT REFLECT EQUALLY THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF GENUINE CRAFT BREWING. SOON, THE BREWERY WILL BEGIN SHIPPING BEER TO CAREFULLY SELECTED RESTAURANTS, BARS, AND RETAIL OUTLETS THROUGHOUT THE REGION.

      THE ARSENAL, BLUEJACKET’S HOME RESTAURANT AND BAR, FEATURES A CONSTANTLY ROTATING SELECTION OF TWENTY BLUEJACKET BEERS AND FIVE BLUEJACKET CASK ALES, ALL POURED AT THE APPROPRIATE TEMPERATURE, AND MOST AVAILABLE ONLY ON-SITE. OUR MENU UPDATES, REFINES AND EXTENDS THE CLASSIC FARE OF BEER HALLS AND PUBLIC HOUSES AND FEATURES THE BEST LOCALLY SOURCED PRODUCTS AVAILABLE.

      THE SPACE THAT BLUEJACKET OCCUPIES IS AS DISTINCTIVE AS THE BREWERY ITSELF. BUILT IN 1919, THE BUILDING - KNOWN AS THE BOILERMAKER SHOPS - WAS PART OF THE NAVY YARDS SHIP AND MUNITIONS MANUFACTURING COMPLEX, AND IT IS ONE OF THE FEW TRUE INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS REMAINING IN WASHINGTON, DC. WE HOPE YOU FIND IT AS INSPIRING AS WE DO AS WE ADD A NEW, VERY DIFFERENT CHAPTER TO ITS HISTORY."
